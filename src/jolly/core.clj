;; REVIEW: New versions of lib-grimoire might allow examples on non-def Things.

;; Notes:
;;
;;  - The doc string of grimoire.api/list-examples is a bit strange. It sounds
;;    like list-examples would return Fail if there are no examples for a
;;    given Thing. This would be a behaviour I wouldn't approve of. – Returning
;;    a Success with an empty list would make more sense to me. Luckily this is
;;    indeed what happens.
;;
;;  - Don't be fooled by the doc string of grimoire.api/list-examples.

;; Note:
;;
;;  - This looks kind of similar to read-examples, but it doesn't have the
;;    grim-t/def? clause, because all Things support notes.
;;
;;  - Unfortunately it also doesn't do the thing that's more sensible than the

;;    no notes on a group. So we need a different clause.
